#Employee-Promotion-Prediction-Model

A major challenge for a multinational company is identifying the right employees for promotion. To address this, the company created training and testing datasets with 12 input features. This project demonstrates the implementation of a decision tree and five ensemble learning algorithms using the training dataset. It also includes a Streamlit application with visualizations to analyze why an employee wasn't promoted.

Tools used:

Jupyter Notebook
Pycharm IDE
Numpy and Pandas
Matplotlib and Seaborn
Scikit-Learn
Joblib
Streamlit
Languages used:

Python
Steps to Install:

Install libraries using pip install -r requirements.txt
Run Streamlit app using streamlit run app.py
Use the web app

Note:
I developed this model as part of my project for the joint master's degree (MS in Data Science and Management) that I am pursuing at IIT Ropar and IIM Amritsar.
