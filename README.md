# Employee-Promotion-Prediction

A major challenge for a multinational company is identifying the right employees for promotion. To address this, the company created training and testing datasets with 12 input features. This project demonstrates the implementation of a decision tree and five ensemble learning algorithms using the training dataset. It also includes a Streamlit application with visualizations to analyze why an employee wasn't promoted.

## Tools used:

- Jupyter Notebook  
- Pycharm IDE  
- Numpy and Pandas  
- Matplotlib and Seaborn  
- Scikit-Learn  
- Joblib  
- Streamlit  

## Languages used:

- Python

## Steps to Install:

1. Install libraries using `pip install -r requirements.txt`  
2. Run Streamlit app using `streamlit run app.py`  
3. Use the web app  
4. Open `employee_promotion_prediction.pdf` to understand the machine learning project in detail.

## Project Context:

I developed this model as part of my project for the joint master's degree (MS in Data Science and Management) that I am pursuing at IIT Ropar and IIM Amritsar. (I have taken references from many resources available)
